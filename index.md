## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de) and [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Cas Cremers](https://people.cispa.io/cas.cremers/). 
My research focuses on the formal analysis of reliable security guarantees for real-world systems. Specifically, I explore the trade-offs between usability, engineering challenges, and security, examining how these factors impact end-user guarantees of communication systems. My work involves analyzing protocols and uncovering vulnerabilities in both confidential computing platforms and secure messaging systems. I am also involved in the [Crypto Proof Ladders](https://proof-ladders.github.io/), an initiative originating from the [HACS](https://www.hacs-workshop.org/) workshop, to provide an introduction to formal methods for Cryptography.

Previously, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s Automated Reasoning Group in Santa Clara, California in Summer 2023.
