## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de) and [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), where I work under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Cas Cremers](https://people.cispa.io/cas.cremers/). 
My research focuses on the formal analysis of reliable security guarantees for real-world systems. Specifically, I explore the trade-offs between usability, engineering challenges, and security, examining how these factors impact end-user guarantees of communication systems. My work includes analyzing and identifying vulnerabilities in protocols like [DMTFâ€™s SPDM](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/spdm) and the [Signal](https://signal.org/) protocols.

Previously, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s Automated Reasoning Group in Santa Clara, California in Summer 2023.
I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at Saarland University and my Bachelor's in Business Informatics at the University of Tirana, Albania. 

### News
